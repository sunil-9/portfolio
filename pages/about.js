                Hi, I&apos;m Sunil Sapkota from Australia. With more than five years of professional experience, I&apos;ve built a versatile skill set across web development, Android development, machine learning, and DevOps. My academic journey of a Master&apos;s in Information Technology from Victoria University Sydney, complemented by a strong foundation in software development and management from my Bachelor&apos;s in Computer Applications at La Grandee International College.

                During college, I began honing my skills in PHP backend and Java-based Android applications. Post-graduation, I deepened my expertise in full-stack developmentâ€”specializing in Node.js and PHP on the backend and React.js for frontend work. In parallel, I embraced infrastructure and automation with Linux systems, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS, evolving into a well-rounded DevOps practitioner.

                My recent roles reflect this blend of disciplines. I served as Assistant Professor at both La Grandee International College and the International School of Management and Technology (ISMT), where I taught Android, Linux, Machine Learning, supported curriculum design, supervised student projects, and contributed to administrative operations. Concurrently, at Oarkflow, I worked as a Full Stack / Machine Learning Engineer, developing production-ready ML systems alongside backend and React.js front ends.

                Earlier in my career, I worked with Gaintplay (Ad Break Media) as a Node.js Backend Developer and DevOps Engineer, handling cloud deployments, Kubernetes on Linode, CI/CD pipelines, and server management. At Race Groups, where I advanced to IT Head, I led development on PHP and MySQL systems, implemented CI/CD processes, managed Docker infrastructure, and oversaw technical operations across four branches.

                I&apos;m a self-driven and resilient professional who thrives in collaborative and high-pressure environments. I continually pursue new learning opportunities to expand my technical and leadership abilities. My key strengths lie in web development, Android development, DevOps infrastructure, and supporting cloud-based systems, especially within AWS environments.ðŸ”¥
